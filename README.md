Hello metacrafters! today I will create a token using what we learned in Solidity.

Since we are creating token. we are using string for our token name and we will call it metacrafters, also for abbreviation which is MTC and totalsupply for the token. we created mapping for the storage of the variable we put and then we create minting process for the token 
all we put in the minting section it will add to totalsupply also in the balance of the token. Last, the burning function 
the totalsupply will less the value of the burned token also the balance will less the value of the burned token.

I will show you how it will work.
First, you need to put the address where you will send the token after that if you want to mint token just put the value of it. to check if it works it will show the green here.
and then it will show the total of token you have. If you want to burn tokens, just put the value of the token and it will burn but if you put too much token thag want to burn and does not have exact balance if will not work. Thats for all, thank you.
